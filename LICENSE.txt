The stone must be taken out of the head alive, before the Toad be
dead, with a peece of cloth of the colour of red Skarlet,
where-withall the toads are much delighted, so that they stretch out
themselves as it were in sport upon that cloth. They cast out the
stone of their head, but instantly they sup it up againe, unlesse it
be taken from them through some secrete hole in the said cloth,
whereby it falleth into a cestern or vessell of water, into which the
Toade dareth not enter, by reason of the coldnes of the water.
